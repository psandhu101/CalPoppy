## Updating the Front End

> Note: Ensure to only pull the src folder, changes were made to flask-server, package.json, and other files to make the project compatible to deploy to Google Cloud App Engine.

1. Check out the gcloud config branch: `git checkout gcloud-config`
2. Pull the src folder from master into gcloud-config: `git checkout master -- src`
3. Add, Commit, and push the changes to gcloud-config to trigger the Github Actions workflow to update the website on Google Cloud App Engine
    * `git add src`
    > You can run `git status` here to check that only files in src are the Changes to be committed
    * `git commit -m "Pulled Master frontend"`
