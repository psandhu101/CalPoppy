const aboutSPR = `Swanton Pacific Ranch (SPR) is a 3200-acre/ satellite property of Cal 
Poly’s off Highway 1, ~60 miles south of San Francisco. It was donated in 1993 by Al Smith a Cal Poly alum, as a “living laboratory 
fostering LBD.”  The Ranch’s landscape is composed of redwood forests, riverine ecosystems, and coastal grasslands. Sharing the rich 
history and research opportunities of SPR has always been a problem with the lack of signage off HWY1 and with the year-round staff 
not usually available to field questions. So, a plan was devised to provide access to this information through an interactive, remotely 
updated, creative outreach tool for researchers and the public, requiring no mediation...and Poppy was born!`;

const aboutCreators = `Poppy was brought to you by Cal Poly students from many different majors, disciplines, backgrounds. 
She is still a work in progress, so if you find any issues you would like to report, please contact:`;
